# C++ Projects Collection

Welcome to my C++ Projects Collection! This repository showcases five different C++ projects, each designed to demonstrate specific programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. Below is a brief overview of each project, labeled as `no-01` through `no-05`.

## Project Summaries

### no-01: Song Collection Display
This project introduces basic C++ programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, memory management, and data encapsulation. It includes classes for managing songs and song collections, demonstrating how to create, manage, and display a collection of songs.

### no-02: Song and Playlist Manager
Building on the previous project, this project adds a command-line interface for managing songs and playlists. It includes features for adding and removing songs, creating and managing playlists, and viewing song details. This project also introduces input validation and basic user interaction.

### no-03: Advanced Playlist Management
This project expands the playlist management system with advanced features such as copying, renaming, and deleting playlists. It also includes dynamic array management and more sophisticated error handling, ensuring that the system is robust and easy to use.

### no-04: Generic Linked List (GLL) Implementation and Testing
This project involves the implementation of a Generic Linked List (GLL) template class in C++. The GLL class supports various data types, including `int`, `string`, and a custom `Thing` class. The project also includes extensive testing to validate the functionality of the GLL class, covering operations like merging, appending, and handling 'goofy' elements.

### no-05: Heap-Based Song Management System
The final project in this collection implements a heap-based song management system. It uses a priority queue (max-heap) to efficiently manage songs based on listening time. The project supports operations like adding songs, marking them as favorites, and removing them. It also includes automated testing using TCL expect scripts, ensuring the system operates correctly under various scenarios.

## How to Use This Repository
Each project is contained within its own directory (`no-01`, `no-02`, etc.). To explore a project, navigate to its directory and refer to the `README.md` file for specific details on compilation, usage, and what was learned during its development.

## About the Author
These projects were created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of C++ programming, data structures, and algorithms. I hope they provide useful insights and examples for others who are learning or looking to improve their C++ skills.
